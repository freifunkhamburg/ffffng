# Refactoring ideas

## TODO

* Test email rendering!
* Get rid of unhandled promise rejection warnings in tests.

## Short term

* Integrate typescript in the build and start migrating the server code.
* Find a nice way to integrate typescript with grunt.
* Bluebird for promises?
* Yarn instead of NPM?

## Mid term

* Typesafe db queries.
* Port complete server to typescript.
* Port the server code to promises and `async` / `await`.
* Use ES6 style imports instead of `require`.
* Store node data in database and export it for gateways.
* Write tests (especially testing quirky node data).
* Allow terminating running tasks via bluebirds cancellation.

## Long term

* Rewrite the admin interface (used lib is unmaintained).
* Rewrite the client in typescript (+ vue?).
* Replace the grunt build system.
* Decentralize node data.
